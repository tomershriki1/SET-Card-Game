# SET Card Game
 "SET" is a card game with a deck of 81 cards, each having four attributes. Players look for sets of three cards where attributes are either all the same or all different. Players place tokens to claim sets, and the dealer manages card handling, checking legality, and awarding points. The game ends when no more sets are possible, and the player with the most points wins.

I successfully completed this project as my second home assignment in the SPL course, and I welcome you to play this game and enjoy!
